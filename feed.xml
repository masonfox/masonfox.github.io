        <title>Codepen Playground</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Codepen, the front end playground for designers and developers. Demo, or it didn’t happen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-codepen&quot;&gt;What is Codepen?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Codepen is an in browser IDE (Integrated Desktop Environment) or online text-editor for short. Just as we develop our code in our respective desktop environments, Codepen allows users to write front end code, process it instantly, and share it with other front-end designers/developers. One of the most interesting aspects of Codepen is the ability to write Javascript, which if you are familiar is a large large large (10x) no no for websites. If a visitor is able to write arbitrary code, such as a Javascript alert(“Hello”), this tells the visitor/potential hacker that they have the ability to execute Javascript on the website. This is a huge deal as it can lead to the acquisition of cookies, which we all know is a disastrous security issue. Codepen prevents this security threat by stripping away potentially dangerous executable code when live updating the code, pretty ingenious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than being able to write HTML, CSS, and Javascript, Codepen allows users to extend their productivity with the addition of not only CSS preprocessors, such as LESS, SASS, Stylus, SCSS, and PostCSS, but also HTML preprocessors! This includes the traditionally loved HAML, as well as Slim, and Jade. I have embedded one of my basic pens that illustrates a css rotation animation. The written with the Slim and SCSS preprocessors. You can view the compiled code by selecting this option when tabbing through the Slim and SCSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sample pen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- Begin Pen --&gt;
&lt;p data-height=&quot;290&quot; data-theme-id=&quot;0&quot; data-slug-hash=&quot;XbQqWY&quot; data-default-tab=&quot;result&quot; data-user=&quot;masonfox&quot; class=&quot;codepen&quot;&gt;See the Pen &lt;a href=&quot;http://codepen.io/masonfox/pen/XbQqWY/&quot;&gt;Spinning Circle&lt;/a&gt; by Mason Fox (&lt;a href=&quot;http://codepen.io/masonfox&quot;&gt;@masonfox&lt;/a&gt;) on &lt;a href=&quot;http://codepen.io&quot;&gt;CodePen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;!-- End Pen --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Codepen also includes other small features such as extending styling possibilities by adding external stylesheets from web sources, such as Bootstrap, jQuery, and many more. Codepen will also take care of vendor prefixing with autoprefixer as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;social-ideology&quot;&gt;Social Ideology&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The online editor includes social aspects by letting others view, heart (essentially liking), comment, and even fork your pen to edit and play with themselves. Codepen also displays the most popular pens each day, which typically showcases revolutionary CSS and Javascript implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;features-of-codepen&quot;&gt;Features of Codepen&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;general-features&quot;&gt;General Features&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Online Code Editor that syncs changes automatically&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Embed Pens on websites (Uses data, not iFrame)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Public pens – Open for all users to see, edit, and fork&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Personal Blog – Holds all pens and posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;pro-features&quot;&gt;Pro Features&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Private Pens – Pens only you can edit and see&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Teacher Mode – Allows one user to write code, such as teacher, and others to watch changes, but not edit, typically for students&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Change the style of pen embeds&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Asset hosting – Host assets, such as images, css, javascript, and more&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Collaborative Code Editing – Collaborative live code editing amongst two users, more on a super pro account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Definitely go and give Codepen a go! It is a wonderful asset for making short demos of code and sharing them with other people.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Jekyll</title>
        <link>http://masonfox.github.io/2015/07/21/Jekyll.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://masonfox.github.io/2015/07/21/Jekyll.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I guess this marks my first “real” post! To start this off, I’d love to talk about Jekyll, something I have become very passionate about within the past couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-jekyll&quot;&gt;What is Jekyll?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll is a static site generator built on Ruby and also utilizing liquid templating. Jekyll is not a server side client, but rather a collection of local scripts that compile separate files into a single static directory. It utilizes liquid templating, which allows users to designate if/else statements, declare specific html layouts, add front matter, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most important concepts of Jekyll is the content and structure separation. As explained briefly earlier, Jekyll keeps the content of the website and the strucutre/layout of the website in separate directories. An example of this would be this blog post. This post is located in the posts directory, which at this moment, is written in markdown. By adding front matter to the top of the post, triggered by three dashes, the user is able to choose a specific layout that coincides with the desired structure of the content. For example, I am writing a post, a Jekyll blog post, so I would note in my front matter in the markdown file In this instance, I would like my layout for this post to be, well, a post! The user is also able to add additional information, such as the time code, the title of the post, and excerpt of the post, an image, and much more! Pages are created in the same exact way, but knowledge of html, css, and liquid templating are required to ensure correct Jekyll builds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pros-of-jekyll&quot;&gt;Pros of Jekyll&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Static sites run faster as there is no database weighing it down. They are solely comprised of html  and their assets.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Easy authoring: written in markdown, so the barrier to entry for new users is very low and simple. A blog post ui was also created and can be linked to your Github Repository at &lt;a href=&quot;http://prose.io&quot;&gt;Prose&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hosted on github pages for free! (This one is)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Simple build and deploy: as simple as running jekyll s (for serve to view the site locally) and jekyll b (for build to compile the directory) in the command line.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dynamic capabilities are possible for static pages, such as An example may be Google Forms to send form data, Disquis comment system and more API’s and embeds.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Supports many frameworks such as Twitter Bootstrap, Foundation 5, and more.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Task runner support, such as Grunt or Gulp or other systems like Codekit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cons-of-jekyll&quot;&gt;Cons of Jekyll&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Not officially supported on Windows as it Jekyll is written in Ruby.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Does not have a database, meaning that it may &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; be the best solution for every project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I definitely recommend going and trying out Jekyll. I have linked a couple videos down here so you can get some information about it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7NBEFmA7yA&quot;&gt;Intro to Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
And of course, the official &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks guys! I can’t wait to write more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;– Mason&lt;/p&gt;
