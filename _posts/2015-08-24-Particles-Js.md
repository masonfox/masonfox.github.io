An interactive Javascript particle script

###About Particles Js
The example above is a snippet from Particles Js. It is a Javascript library intended to help designers and developers inject interactive particle effects into their designs. It is functionally written in Javascript. Particles Js is implemented in HTML & CSS by a div with an ID of particle and some specific CSS, but other than that, it is fairly straight-forward.

###Configuration
The creator of the library, Vincent Garreau, created a [UI](http://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/) to help users configure their Particles script. The example posted within the excerpt of the post is the "grab" interactive configuration. Below is an example of the "repulse" function of Particles Js.

<p data-height="268" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="OVKpqM" data-default-tab="result" data-user="masonfox" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/masonfox/pen/OVKpqM/'>particles.js demo</a> by Mason Fox (<a href='http://codepen.io/masonfox'>@masonfox</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>

Using the UI allows designers and developers customization over the library to outfit their intended goal.

###Internet Aestheticism
Particles Js does not really serve any specific purpose, nor does its implementation other than exploring and pushing the boundaries of front end development. I first saw it on a previous co-workers website and wondered how it was written. I inspected it, but was unable to find much information on it within Chrome dev tools. I ended up stumbling across it on [codepen](http://codepen.io/VincentGarreau/pen/pnlso) where I forked it and played around with it a little bit.

I find Javascript libraries similar to Particles Js to be really interesting. They enhance the user's visual and interactive experience. I definitely would like to learn more about similar libraries and implement them within future designs.
