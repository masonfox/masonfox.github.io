A javascript and jQuery interactive agency name generator <br>
**Picked on Codepen**

Hello, it has been a while since I have posted! I have been working on a project with a friend and spending a large portion of my free time coding up demos on [Codepen](http://codepen.io). I have spoken about Codepen before and suggest it to any web designer/developer. With a newly redesigned website, Codepen is becoming more and more integral into my design and development workflow.

With this increased time spent on Codepen, I have been throwing demos together of ideas that I have. One of these ideas was this agency name generator. The idea came from stumbling across some really interesting agency names. I figured I would take advantage of this and make a fun little tool, if you can even call it that! It essentially uses math random to pull from two variables, both consisting of a name, which combined creates two words culminating into a creative agency name. You can then add "creative" to top off the experience and also remove it if you aren't feeling the mainstream title.

I feel very blessed to say that this pen was picked on Codepen. This is when one of the three creators of Codepen, specifically the front end designer/developer, Chris Coiyer, selects pens of their personal liking. Chris has been a huge influence on me and my initial and continued interest and my ultimately my career in web design and development. I feel very blessed to have been noticed in this way!

Any who, check it out: :)
