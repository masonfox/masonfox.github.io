<p>My name is Mason Fox and I am a web and graphic designer and a kinda sorta web developer.</p>

<p>I am 22 years old and live with my wife in a small town called Stryker, Ohio where the corn out populates the people. I am currently a senior at Bowling Green State University and work part time as a web and graphic designer at a company in Maummee, Ohio named Service Spring Corporation. After graduation, I will be working for SSC full-time continuing to design graphic and web products as well as continue to dabble in client side development.</p>

<p>I will be graduating in the Fall of 2015 where I have been challenged to write about my continued learning of Javascript, jQuery, and PHP. So, throughout the rest of the Summer and the Fall of 2015, maybe longer, I will be posting articles that are relevant to JS, jQ, PHP, and more, like Jekyll.</p>

<p>This website was built on a platform called Jekyll. Jekyll is a static html generator where data in files is actually, well, stored in files instead of a database like many CMS&rsquo;s, or any system that runs off of PHP or Ruby.</p>

<p>Jekyll&rsquo;s output eventually compiles into a single directory of files that include: folders for each page, a single html file, a directory for posts, and assets that include css, which is compiled from SASS by Jekyll, Javascript, and jQuery, and more. One of the really cool versitile options of Jekyll is that posts can be written in either Markdown or HTML, giving a very low barrier to entrance for many who may be interested in web design.</p>

<p>If you are interested in <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, feel free to visit the website, it is built on Ruby, so mac users are good to go, windows users, there are definitely some resources out there to help install ruby, Jekyll, and its dependencies online. I will be making a post about Jekyll here within the first couple weeks to give it a little bit more spotlight.</p>

<p>Thanks for checking out my blog!</p>

<p>– Mason</p>
