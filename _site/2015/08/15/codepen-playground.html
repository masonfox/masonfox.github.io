    <p>Codepen, the front end playground for designers and developers. Demo, or it didn’t happen!</p>

<h3 id="what-is-codepen">What is Codepen?</h3>

<p>Codepen is an in browser IDE (Integrated Desktop Environment) or online text-editor for short. Just as we develop our code in our respective desktop environments, Codepen allows users to write front end code, process it instantly, and share it with other front-end designers/developers. One of the most interesting aspects of Codepen is the ability to write Javascript, which if you are familiar is a large large large (10x) no no for websites. If a visitor is able to write arbitrary code, such as a Javascript alert(“Hello”), this tells the visitor/potential hacker that they have the ability to execute Javascript on the website. This is a huge deal as it can lead to the acquisition of cookies, which we all know is a disastrous security issue. Codepen prevents this security threat by stripping away potentially dangerous executable code when live updating the code, pretty ingenious.</p>

<p>Other than being able to write HTML, CSS, and Javascript, Codepen allows users to extend their productivity with the addition of not only CSS preprocessors, such as LESS, SASS, Stylus, SCSS, and PostCSS, but also HTML preprocessors! This includes the traditionally loved HAML, as well as Slim, and Jade. I have embedded one of my basic pens that illustrates a css rotation animation. The written with the Slim and SCSS preprocessors. You can view the compiled code by selecting this option when tabbing through the Slim and SCSS.</p>

<p>A sample pen:</p>

<!-- Begin Pen -->
<p data-height="290" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="XbQqWY" data-default-tab="result" data-user="masonfox" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/masonfox/pen/XbQqWY/">Spinning Circle</a> by Mason Fox (<a href="http://codepen.io/masonfox">@masonfox</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async="" src="//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

<!-- End Pen -->
<p><br /></p>

<p>Codepen also includes other small features such as extending styling possibilities by adding external stylesheets from web sources, such as Bootstrap, jQuery, and many more. Codepen will also take care of vendor prefixing with autoprefixer as well.</p>

<h3 id="social-ideology">Social Ideology</h3>
<p>The online editor includes social aspects by letting others view, heart (essentially liking), comment, and even fork your pen to edit and play with themselves. Codepen also displays the most popular pens each day, which typically showcases revolutionary CSS and Javascript implementation.</p>
